# hq-blog
Hyperqualia is a blog about immersive and experiential media, visual music, and event production, in New Zealand, and beyond.

The mission is to celebrate the work of local and international practitioners. 

The blog's main feed has all the articles in chronological order.
The articles are tagged, and we can filter the viewed articles by checkboxing tags.

There is also an about page, and a directory page.
The about page simply states the hq mission, and the directory page has profiles of featured associates.

## Project Setup

This project will be a minimalist dark-themed tech blog using Vite for hot reloading and Jekyll compatibility for GitHub Pages deployment. The structure will include:

- A homepage showcasing recent posts with excerpts.
- Individual post pages with good typography.
- Smooth navigation and subtle animations.
- An about page stating the mission.
- A directory page with profiles of featured associates.

### Key Features

- Fast loading and easy iteration.
- Avoids React for simplicity.
- Modern and sophisticated design inspired by deltaprocess.it.

### Next Steps

1. Set up the `_posts` folder for blog articles.
2. Create `_layouts` for Jekyll templates.
3. Add `assets` for CSS and JavaScript files.
4. Configure Vite for hot reloading.
5. Implement the homepage, about page, and directory page.
